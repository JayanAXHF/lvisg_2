                Our journey to global networking began in 2012 with our tie up
                Brown University, an Ivy League Research University, Rhode
                Island, United States. Brown University and Lotus Valley
                alliance has opened new doors for our students and teachers to
                reach the pinnacle. The experience so far has been quite
                enriching, both in terms of interaction of prof. Kenneth Wong
                and his team of teachers and students with our students mainly
                through Skype sessions. The prospects of our learners would be
                in best hands with a guarantee of a lucrative future.

                    followed by Headmistress Mrs. Harvinder Kaur to the UK

                    learning a language, it enables us to explore one of the
                    most ancient culture of the world and is the most widely
                    spoken language in the world. Lotus Valley decided to
                    venture into the field of Chinese Language with the start of
                    the Mandarin Club which prompted us to form the &apos;Lotus
