              younger generation is given an opportunity to be with the children
              with special needs in inclusive classrooms. She has been the
              driving force behind creating a culture that promotes
              accessibility and inclusion within the Lotus Valley Family. She
              motivates the school as well as parents to nurture children in an
              atmosphere of discovery, enquiry, learning, expression and
              communication. Her journey in pursuit of inclusion is a testimony
              to the fact that when everyone is included, everyone wins.
